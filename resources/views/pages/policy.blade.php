      <h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>The Maker Group LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) has established the following Cookie and Privacy Policy
      (“Policy”) so that you can make an informed decision regarding your information. This Policy
      applies to information collected from users of this website (“Site”), our Client Portal (as defined by
      our Terms of Use), and our professional services. <br>
      The sections below explain how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information as well as
      what rights you have with respect to this information. The terms 'you' and ‘your’ refer to any user
      or viewer of this Site or the user or purchaser of any of our services.</p>

      <h3>2. CONSENT TO AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS POLICY</h3>
      <p>By submitting any information by email, through this Site or its associated Client Portal, or
      otherwise to The Maker Group LLC, or by your continued use of this Site, you expressly agree to this
      Policy, as well as to the collection, use, and disclosure of information as described by this Policy. If
      you do not or cannot agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, you must immediately cease
      access and use of this Site, the Client Portal, and any of our services.</p>
      <h3>3. MODIFICATION OF THIS POLICY</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to limit, modify, or otherwise add to, amend, eliminate or suspend this Policy,
in whole or in part, at any time. The effective date is stated at the top of this page following the
words “Effective Date.” Changes to this Policy will be posted on this Site and, unless otherwise

<h3>4. INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
<p>The Maker Group LLC collects two kinds of information from users of this Site, the Client Portal, or
our services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. Personal Information is any

you do not want to disclose any Personal Information to us, you should choose not to submit it.</p>
<h3>5. SOURCES AND USES OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h3>
<p>The information we collect comes from three sources: (1) Site, Client Portal, and service users who
voluntarily provide information, (2) web server logs, and (3) cookies. Web server logs are
maintained in the process of hosting this Site by the hosting company, and cookies are small text
files stored locally by a user’s browser, if that user’s browser has the option enabled.<br>
Web server logs and cookies (if your web browser accepts them) collect information automatically
from Site users. However, this information is only Non-Personal information relating to Site
visitation, which is collected primarily so that we or our service providers may analyze this

profile, complete questionnaires and surveys, and share other business information and objectives
with us within their personal Client Account.<br>This information is requested and collected when and only when practically required by the
provision of our services to you, and no Site user is required to use or purchase any service from us.<br>However, the quality of our consultation and other services will depend upon the completeness,
