<h3>12. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
<p>THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY OF OUR SERVICES OR THESE TERMS, INCLUDING ANY QUESTION
REGARDING THEIR FORMATION, TERMINATION, EXISTENCE, VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY, OR
APPLICABILITY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL BE ARBITRATED.<br>WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY
BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR
REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and The Maker Group LLC agree, no arbitrator or
judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a class,
collective, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court, the
parties waive any right to trial by jury.<br>THESE LIMITATIONS OF RELIEF ARE A PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.<br>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing
your dispute with or claim against us mailed and addressed as follows:
<br><ul>
  <li>The Maker Group, LLC, ATTN: Arbitration of Dispute, PO Box 9751, 225 S. Broadway Ave,
Denver, CO 80209.</li>
</ul><br>
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and judicial review of arbitration awards is limited.
However, arbitrators can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court, and
must apply and follow these Terms as a court would.<br>The parties agree that any and all arbitration will be conducted by Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Services (JAMS). Any party may submit a dispute to final and binding arbitration by a
single arbitrator through (a) JAMS Streamlined (for claims under $250,000), (b) JAMS
Comprehensive (for all other claims), (c) any successor of JAMS if JAMS is no longer in existence, or
(d) any similar arbitration group that can provide a former judge if JAMS is no longer in existence
and without successor.<br>Any arbitrator selected shall be chosen by JAMS, or another arbitration group, on the basis, if
possible, of his or her experience in the subject matter(s) of the dispute. The decision of the
arbitrator shall be final, non-appealable, and binding upon the parties, and it may be entered in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall take place in the City and County of Denver,
State of Colorado. The arbitrator shall be bound by the laws of the State of Colorado applicable to
the issues, without regard to its choice or conflicts of law rules. The parties waive the right to seek punitive damages and the arbitrator shall have no authority to award such damages. The arbitrator
shall issue a detailed written opinion setting forth his or her decision and the reasons therefor
within thirty (30) days after the arbitration proceeding is concluded.<br>The arbitrator, as part of his or her final award, within his or her sole discretion, shall have the
power, but not the obligation, to allocate direct and indirect costs and fees against any and all
parties as he or she deems equitable. Any party seeking enforcement of any arbitration award shall
be entitled to an award of all costs, fees, and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees,
incurred in enforcing the award, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered. The
obligation of the parties to submit any dispute arising under or related to this Agreement to
arbitration shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. The existence,
content, and result of the arbitration shall be held in confidence by the parties, their
representatives, any other participants, and the arbitrator. All documents, discovery, and other
information related to any such dispute, and the attempts to resolve or arbitrate such dispute, will
be kept confidential to the fullest extent possible.
</p>
<h3>13. OPTING OUT OF ARBITRATION</h3>
<p>You have the option to opt out of arbitration. If you do so, neither party may require the other to
participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must directly notify us in writing within
thirty (30) days of the date that you first became subject to these Terms and Section 12 (above).<br>You must use this address to notify us of your decision to opt out of arbitration:

the subject matter of this document. In the event that any provision of these Terms is declared to be
void, invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable by any arbitrator, court, or tribunal of competent
jurisdiction, such provision shall be interpreted to give greatest effect to the intentions of the
parties or, if necessary, shall be deemed severed from the remainder of this agreement and the
